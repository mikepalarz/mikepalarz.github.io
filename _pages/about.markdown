## About Me

I live in the Chicago-land area and currently work at Motorola Solutions in our downtown office. I started my career as an RF engineer. However, as time progressed, I became very interested in programming. I've since decided to make a career change into Android development and taking classes through [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com). It's involved me taking a leap of faith from a comfortable and overall promising career in RF into the seemingly mysterious and overwhelmingly intimidating path of software development. Many people often contemplate making a career change yet not many succeed. Here's a bit of background on my story so far.

### The Spark

It all started with a repetitive task. It was something that I couldn't sit through and bear to work on over and over again. There *must* be a way to automate this, right? There certainly was and I was about to see it for myself first-hand. We use GIS software, most notably [ESRI ArcMap](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/) for portions of our work. One feature of ArcMap allows end users to create custom Python-based scripts and plug-ins to make their lives easier if need be. Another co-worker had already written a Python script to automate some things and I decided to see if I could make use of it some how. There lied the resolution to my reptitive task. I started poking around, changing one variable here, adding a couple there, pulled up some documentation. Before I knew it, I was in this deep, completely enclosing rabbit hole of programming... And I was hooked.

### The Change

Unfortunately, that spark didn't ignite a massive inferno of raccoon-eyed, coding-into-the-wee-hours craziness like it may have for some people. I still had some personal struggles of my own to get through first. I knew that I really enjoyed programming (although I still don't know Python very well to this day) and I continued to dabble while not really knowing what I was doing. However, my RF workload would always take over. And the harder pill to swallow was that I have a master's degree in Electrical Engineering *with* a specialization in Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and Telecommunications. The question that kept ringing in my head was:

> *How could I dive into programming, if I already have this master's degree in RF? Man, I really don't want to go back to school... I should probably settle and stick to RF.*

Reality really clarified that question for me as time progressed. I started at Motorola in 2012 as a co-op. I was expected to work 40 hours/week as well as taking 6-9 credit hours of grad level courses. I also had to get at least a B in my classes. It was a pretty challenging point in my life and I didn't have much of a social life. I was to be graduating in 2015 with my master's degree, which meant that it was time for Motorola to bring me a full-time job offer. The scary part was... I didn't know if I was going to get it. There had been a lot of downsizing in the company at the time and there was a lot of uncertainty if I'd be able to get an offer, especially since a lot of poeple were leaving. 

This was the slap of reality that I needed. I started frantically trying to come up with a backup plan by looking at job positions in the Chicago-land area for RF. My options weren't very great. There were a few positions that I may have wanted to apply for, but they were few and far between. There were a lot of RF positions outside of the midwest, but I couldn't stomach the idea of moving. All of my family is here, along with my friends. Making a move somewhere out west/east would be a very difficult personal challenge. However, there were plenty of programming positions available, which is what really caused me to start looking at my career a lot differently than I ever did before. My question changed from what it was previously to:

> *Why not do programming? There are so many more career options. Plus, you enjoy it!*

I didn't want to end up working (those awful 86,400 hours of my life) in a job that I didn't really enjoy. I wanted something that I was passionate about. In the end, I ended up getting the job offer and applied for a full-time positions as a Systems Engineer in 2015. I've since been promoted to a Senior Systems Engineer in 2017. But that question never went away. And I continued to pursue answering it.

### Progress

I am currently a student at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) pursuing a [Nanodegree in Android development](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801). There were so many different paths that I could have taken with my interest in programming, but I decided to go with Android. I already came from a Java background from undergrad (although very, very rusty) and I already really enjoyed Android as an end-user (although I owned an iPhone in another life...). I've written up a [few apps as projects](https://github.com/mikepalarz) for the course and am currently working on my capstone project. Deciding to make a career change has been a very challenging yet fulfilling experience for me. And I wouldn't even know where to begin on how much I've learned by taking the courses at Udacity. Stay tuned for my progress and check out my [articles](../_pages/articles.html) in the mean time.

### A Bit More About Me

There's more to me than just my career story. Contrary to what many people may think of engineers, I'm  actually a very sociable person.
