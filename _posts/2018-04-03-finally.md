# About Time
This is something that I've wanted to do for the longest time: have my own piece of Internet real-estate. With this blog, I'll be focusing on writing articles relating to Android development, but I may dive into any sort of topic that I'm interested in and I feel would benefit the Internet community. I've decided to create this blog using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). There's so many ways to create your own blog in today's world, but here are the reasons I went with the GitHub Pages + Jekyll combo:

* It's developer-centric.
* Although it's developer-centric, it's still simple enough to pick up and hit the ground running. Once I got past installing Jekyll on my PC, I was pretty much good to go. Sweet!
* There doesn't seem to have an overwhelming amount of overhead, which is something that turned me away from WordPress (plugins, plugins, and more plugins...).
* The main premise of Jekyll really appealed to me, which is *creating content*. I don't need to be a web-developer in order to use this.
* If I wanted to poke around with some web dev though, I also have that option. Maybe I'll create my own Jekyll theme one day... 

Anyways, that's all I got for you guys for now. Hang tight for more to come!
